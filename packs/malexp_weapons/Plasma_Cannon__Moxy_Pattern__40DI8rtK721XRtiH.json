      "player": "The largest man-portable plasma weapon is the plasma cannon or heavy plasma gun, which is also seen in service on some Imperial war machines. Rather than using attached flasks, the wielder wears a large backpack containing the weaponâ€™s store of hydrogen fuel. This weapon has a much longer range and ammunition supply, and its violent discharges, hurled like miniature suns from the barrel, have a large impact area. It can also be fired in a special Supercharge mode that exhausts more fuel but provides an even larger blast of heat on impact, creating a fireball capable of destroying heavily armoured targets.",

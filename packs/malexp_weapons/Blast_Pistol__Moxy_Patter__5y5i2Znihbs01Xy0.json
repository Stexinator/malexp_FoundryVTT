      "player": "The Blast Pistol is a variant of the standard Imperial Laspistol used by the Solar Auxilia during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy. The weapons were able to fire only a handful of shots before reloading, but their stopping power rivalled that of a Volkite Weapon. They were only produced by master weaponsmiths for the officer class and colonial nobility, compromising range with extreme lethality. For Post-Great Crusade Games, they are worth 24,000 Solars and are Exotic.",

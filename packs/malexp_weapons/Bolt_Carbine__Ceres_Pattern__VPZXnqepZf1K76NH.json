      "player": "Relatively uncommon weapons (the design was said to have been rescued from a space hulk and pressed into production specifically for the long-ago Angevin Crusade), Bolt Carbines are typically easier to wield than full-size Boltguns, due to lighter, simpler construction and a lower rate of fire. Without the multi-round burst ability common to many patterns of Bolter, a Bolt Carbine is incapable of the wholesale slaughter that characterizes volleys of bolter fire. However, their simpler design means that they misfire less frequently and are much easier to maintain.",

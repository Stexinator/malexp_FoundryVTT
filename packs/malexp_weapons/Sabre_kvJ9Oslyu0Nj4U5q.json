      "player": "A favored weapon of cavalry troops and other mounted warriors, a saber is a sword with a long, curved, single-edged blade. The weaponâ€™s excellent balance allows riders to keep a hand free to control their mounts, and its utility and effectiveness make it a very responsive weapon in skilled hands. Sabers persist in use in far more sophisticated climes and are popular with many Imperial Guard officers and hive nobles, often featuring mono-edge blades and even power field generators to enhance their effectiveness.",

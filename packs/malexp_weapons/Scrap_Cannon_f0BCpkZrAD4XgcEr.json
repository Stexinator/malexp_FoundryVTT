Made from a crudely reinforced length of pipe packed with black powder and rammed with nails, bolts, and anything else nasty scraped from the underhive floor. Scrap cannons are hugely unwieldy and not very lethal. However, they look scary and make an impressively enormous bang and pyrotechnic blast when fired, added to which the ammo is more or less free!",

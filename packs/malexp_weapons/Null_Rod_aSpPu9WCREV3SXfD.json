      "player": "Tests made to Manifest a psychic power that targets the Zone of the wielder, any individual within that Zone, or made within Short Range of a wielder of a Null weapon, suffers from Disadvantage. Additionally, daemons treat the Zone of a wielder with a Null weapon as a Minor Hazard. Null Rods are tall, obsidian rods, crackling with antipsychic energy, nullifying warp power within its area. A blow from a Null Rod can tear apart daemonic essence and trigger a cascade of cataclysmic energy within the mind of a rogue psyker. After battles and engagements, Null Rods must safely discharge their energy, lest they create rifts to the Warp. A Null Rod is a weapon commonly employed by the Ordo Malleus but not exclusive to them. When a Null Rod strikes a creature with a Warp Threshold, it gains Rend (X), where the X is the current Warp Charge of the target. Additionally, the first time a Null Rod strikes a psyker each day, the psyker must immediately make a Difficult (âˆ’10) Psychic Mastery Test and, upon failure, suffer Perils of the Warp.",

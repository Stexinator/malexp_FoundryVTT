      "player": "A Paragon Blade is an ancient melee weapon first forged by unknown means during the Dark Age of Technology in pre-Imperial times. These blades were few in number even in the early days of the Horus Heresy and took a number of forms. The most common Paragon Blades are two-handed Power Weapons of extraordinary balance and durability. For Post-Great Crusade Games, their starting price will be at least 3,000,000 Solars and Exotic, but can go upwards of 5,000,000 Solars.",

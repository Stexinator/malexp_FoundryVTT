Typically hidden in piles of debris along heavily traveled routes, they are equipped with sensitive bio- monitors that can sense even the weakest bio-signs within Immediate Range Once a bio-sign has been detected, a small shaped charge propels the hopper roughly two meters into the air where it detonates, spraying an area five meters (roughly a zone) across with lethal shrapnel.",

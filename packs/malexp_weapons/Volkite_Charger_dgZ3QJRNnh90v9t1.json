      "player": "The Volkite Charger was the assault weapon variant of a Volkite Weapon carried by Space Marine infantry and the military forces of the Mechanicum. Whilst not benefiting from the range or power of its larger cousins, the Charger retained the Volkite thermal ray's deflagrating effects and allowed its wielder a greater degree of movement. Volkite Chargers were often employed by Legion Tactical Support Squads.\nUnder normal Imperial circumstances, all\nweapons worsen their availability by one step\n(Common to Scarce, etc) and increase their costs by\nsomewhere between 2 â€“ 5x the original amount, as\nappropriate to the weapon.",

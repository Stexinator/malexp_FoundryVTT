They were capable of a much higher rate of fire than a standard Boltgun but their weight and recoil meant that they were only used by heavily augmented machines such as Battle-automata, Karkinos Servitors, or Myrmidons.\nUnder normal Imperial circumstances, all\nweapons worsen their availability by one step\n(Common to Scarce, etc) and increase their costs by\nsomewhere between 2 â€“ 5x the original amount, as\nappropriate to the weapon.",

      "player": "An eccentric design of the Forge World Core Theta in the As kellon Sector, the cannon uses the principals of graviton weaponry, but with a wildly different effect. It projects a pulsing orb of gravitic energy that shatters on contact. A second later, the rapid mass increase draws anything nearby towards the center, crushing it in a gruesome manner. After being fired, the cannon creates a gravitic anomaly within the Zone it detonates in that persists for 1d5 rounds. Whenever a character begins their turn in this area, they must make a Hard (-20) Athletics (Might) or Reflexes (Dodge) test. If they fail, they are Immobilized until the end of their turn and suffer a single automatic hit to a randomly determined location for 12 damage with the Penetrating (4) Quality.",

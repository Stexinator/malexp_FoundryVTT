      "player": "Swords of common or non-descript designs, doubleedged or single, as ornate or commonplace as any other blade across the galaxy. What makes the Blink-Blade special is how they are sheathed and unsheathed. The bearer does not carry a scabbard for such a weapon, as the blade is sheathed and unsheathed seemingly from thin air. These blades are unnaturally sharp, and the ability to make the blade disappear and reappear in a new grip or new orientation makes it difficult to defend against. The weapon is unusual and exceptionally heretical, therefore not commonly found among the Inquisition; instead acquired from exceedingly Radical sources. The strange nature of the weapons demands a bond with its wielder, an attunement with their mind, to sheathe and unsheathe it. A character that wishes to bond with the weapon can make a series of Difficult (âˆ’10) Willpower Tests, one per hour, and when the character has earned 5 SL, they have bonded to the weapon. The Blink-Blade is impossible to detect when sheathed. The wielder must succeed on a Challenging (+0) Discipline Test to unsheathe the weapon. If they fail, the weapon does not appear. When attacking with the blade, it ignores the Defensive quality of other weapons.",

# JSON Data
Here go the json (thus human readable content) data.
One folder per pack folder of the module and within all the contained, unpacked json files (one per entry).

Using the `extract_packs` scripts will overwrite the json files currently in this folder with those contained in the ldb file in `build/packs/...`

Using the `build` script will overwrite the ldb file in the `build/packs/...` folder with one created from the json files within the various packs here.

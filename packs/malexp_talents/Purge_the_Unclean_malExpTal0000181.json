If the test succeeds, the Warp Entity is repelled a number of zones away equal to half your Willpower Bonus (rounded up). It cannot approach closer than this distance for 2d5 rounds. You may also spend a Fate Point to speak the rites of Exorcism and force out a possessing warp entity from its host. The same test as before, if you succeed, the Warp Entity is driven out of whatever or whoever it possessed and manifests in the same Zone as its former host. It may not possess the same host again for a number of hours equal to twice your character’s Willpower Bonus.</em></span></p>",
